Send job using screen. Usage:

   mjm send command

or

   mjm send -t tag -p priority -n niceness command

where priority can be very-high, high, normal, low, very-low, and niceness is
the niceness parameter to be passed to nice. The job is sent to a newly created
screen session with name derived from tag and can be reattached with the attach
command.
