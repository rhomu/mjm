# MJM: Minimal job manager written in bash (yes in bash)

## Description
MJM is a minimal job manager for personal use on a single computer. It provides
simple means to send and manage jobs. Stop wasting your computing power while
sleeping or taking a shower!

Its main features are:
* All the jobs are sent to `screen` for easy management and interaction.
* Simple queue with maximum number of simultaneously running jobs.
* Allows for priority settings (very-high, high, normal, low, very-low).

## Installation
The program consists of a bunch of bash scripts and is provided with a simple
simple installation script.

To install locally, run:
```
chmod u+x install
./install
```
The script is going to create the necessary directories and configuration files.

## Simple Usage
Command specific help can be obtained via
```
mjm help [cmd]
```
where `cmd` is one of the available commands.

### Sending jobs
```
mjm send cmd
```
where cmd is the command to be executed. Note that quotation marks should be
used for more complicated commands, e.g. `mjm send "cmd1 && cmd2"`.

Options:
* `-p priority`: sets priority of the job (very-high, high, normal, low, \
very-low). Jobs with higher priority run before all the other lower priority \
jobs.
* `-n name`: gives a name to job.

### Showing the queue
```
mjm list
```
print list of all running and queuing jobs in queue order. The job names given
here are the names used through the program.

Options:
* `-p`: prints only the job names.
* `-q`: prints only queued jobs.
* `-r`: prints only running jobs.

### Interacting with running/queuing jobs
```
mjm attach job
```
attach to the screen session corresponding to a given job. Can be required in
order to interact with a running job. Depending on you settings the job can be
detached by typing `Ctrl-a` and then 'd'. If the job fails or Ctrl-C is used,
check that the stopped job is not showing in the queue any more. Use
`mjm purge job` to delete it from the queue database.

```
mjm kill job1 job2 ...
```
kill given jobs.

### Debugging
```
mjm pid job1 job2 ...
```
prints PIDs of given jobs. Jobs can be safely killed with the `kill` command.

```
mjm purge [job1 job2 ...]
```
completely wipe out all queue information for given jobs. If no job is given,
do it for all jobs. Can be useful if jobs still show in the queue but are not
running any more.

```
mjm unlock
```
unlock queue. MJM uses a global lock to avoid race conditions while accessing
the queue files. Can be useful if something went wrong while submitting a job.
